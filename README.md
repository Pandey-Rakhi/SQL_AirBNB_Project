# SQL_AirBNB_Project
In SQL “AirBNB Project” I utilized various queries, including group by clauses and multiple joins, to clean and manipulate the data. By applying these techniques, I was able to gain valuable insights into the grocery products dataset. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that showcased my strong SQL skills and data analysis expertise.
